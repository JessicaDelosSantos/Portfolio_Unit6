    <h1> About Me: </h1>
    <h2> Jessica Read-De los Santos</h2>
    <p> I was born in Manhattan in New York City, and raised in San Pedro de Macoris,
    Dominican Republic. When my twin and I turned 6, we moved back to the city to start kindergarten.
    I currently live in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and go to CRNYHS in El Barrio.
    I turned 15 in August, and love clothes, candy, and cats. I'm new to computer coding,
    but I've been able to learn many things thorugh the ScriptEd program. I love listening to music.
    Below are my favorite artists of all time.</p>
